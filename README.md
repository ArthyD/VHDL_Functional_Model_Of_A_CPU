# Functional CPU

VHDL Project to provide functional model of a CPU based on RiscV.

## Description of project

Projet is divided into several files :
* System : main part that models the full CPU
* cpu_defs_pack : provide all constant and subtype used in project (contains opcode)
* cpu_trace_pack : provide the procedures to trac CPU activity
* logicArithm_defs_pack : provides all function and procedures to make arithmetic or logical operations
* flag_handler_pack : provides all function and procedures to deal with flags
* bit_vector_natural_pack : 

_Library used_ :
  - IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164
  - IEEE.NUMERIC_STD
  - std.textio
