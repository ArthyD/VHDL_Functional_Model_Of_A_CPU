What's need to be implemented ?

INSTRUCTIONS

RORC      010011XXYY--      Rotate Y right by one bit through Carry and assign the result to X
ROR       010010XXYY--      Rotate Y right by one bit and assign the result to X
ROLC      010001XXYY--      Rotate Y left by one bit through Carry and assign the result to X
ROL       010000XXYY--      Rotate Y left by one bit and assign the result to X
SRA       001111XXYY--      Shift Y right by one bit (conserving sign bit) and assign the result to X
SRL       001110XXYY--      Shift Y right by one bit (not conserving sign bit) and assign the result to X
SLL       001101XXYY--      Shift Y left by one bit and assign the result to X
REX       001100XXYY--      Use XOR operator on all bits of Y and assign it to the least significant bit of X

SUB       000100XXYYZZ      X := Y – Z


FUNCTIONS
- dump_memory
- read input 
- write output

CONDUCT TESTS
Write instructions in the memory file with the format CODE XX YY ZZ and check the trace.

Use input and check the output
